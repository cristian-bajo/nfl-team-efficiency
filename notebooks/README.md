# Notebooks

This folder contains the analysis notebooks for the NFL Team Efficiency project.

- `01_data_cleaning.ipynb` → load the dataset, clean columns, handle missing values, and prepare team-season aggregates.  
- `02_analysis.ipynb` → exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and statistical summaries.  

Notebooks are written in Python and will use `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
