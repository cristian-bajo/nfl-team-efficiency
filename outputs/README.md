# Outputs

This folder stores generated results from the analysis, such as:

- Visualizations (e.g., scatterplots of points scored vs win %, heatmaps of correlations).  
- Summary tables or CSVs with aggregated statistics.  

These files are small, static outputs that showcase the insights of the analysis.  
The raw dataset itself is not stored here (see `/data/` for instructions).
